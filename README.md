# Git Tutorial

In this simple tutorial, we will be using a simple Express app that prints `Hello World` on `http://localhost:5000`

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

	You can use your favorite package manager to install all the dependencies for this project.

	Example- `npm install` or `yarn install`

2. Run the dev script

	The `package.json` contains a dev script when running the server locally. It uses `nodemon` that updates the automatically server when changes are made.

	Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`

3. Checking the response

	After running the dev script, you should see the server response on the console. Additionally, if you go to `http://localhost:5000/` you should see a "Hello World" message.
